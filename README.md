🎥 Action Recognition from Weizmann Dataset
This project is a Computer Vision-based Action Recognition System that classifies human actions like walking, running, jumping, and waving using the Weizmann dataset.
It processes action images to create a video, trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and performs real-time action detection with bounding boxes using MediaPipe and OpenCV.

⚙️ Key Features
✔️ Action recognition for walking, running, jumping, and waving
✔️ MediaPipe Pose estimation with bounding box visualization
✔️ Real-time action prediction overlay on video
✔️ Simple CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras
✔️ Works with custom datasets (Weizmann formatted)

➡️ Follow the detailed setup instructions in the docs.
Includes steps to:
Organize your dataset
Train your model
Run the action recognition video pipeline
